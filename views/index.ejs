                        General knowledge is something that really helps us to grow both on personal as well as academic level. It narrows our sense of perceiving the world, understands, and analyzes the situations better as one would without proper knowledge. General knowledge
                        opens gateways our thinking, and take it to a level from where the whole world seems to be a better place. It is an unpredictable world and we all need to stay aware and vigilant. An individual who is well aware with current affairs
                        and facts about the world is called an intellectual.
